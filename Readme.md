# 🌦 Weather Assistant – LLM Powered Application

A full-stack web application that allows users to ask natural-language weather queries (e.g., *“What is the weather in Pune?”*) and receive real-time responses using a Large Language Model integrated with a weather tool.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of a **React frontend** with a **FastAPI backend**, where user queries are processed using **LangChain** and an **LLM via OpenRouter**.  
The backend intelligently detects weather-related queries and fetches live weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**, returning a human-readable response.
